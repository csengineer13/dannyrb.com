I'm Danny, a full-stack web developer at [Renovo Solutions](http://renovo1.com/), a medical equipment service and management company located in Hartville, Ohio.

I created this blog to promote tech literacy and giving back to the tech community. It's also a personal growth challenge to continue my own research and education in tech. You can find me hanging around the [UX StackExchange](http://ux.stackexchange.com/), at local [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/akron-io/), and outdoors playing tennis when the weather cooperates.
