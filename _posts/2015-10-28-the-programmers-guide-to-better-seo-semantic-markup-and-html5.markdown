Search Engines. Their goal is to provide the highest quality, most up-to-date, and most relevant content related to what their end user is looking for. To do this, they send out little bots to [crawl and index](https://www.google.com/insidesearch/howsearchworks/crawling-indexing.html) trillions of web pages to organize and categorize them. This means that programmed bots read your web page to determine:

- It's Quality
- What "Keywords" your content relates to
- How recent/relevant your content is

And many more factors that ultimately weigh into each page on your website's [page rank](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html).

Unfortunately, most websites are uneccessarily hard for these bots to read. Because of this, the bots are forced to make "best guesses" about the content; often causing less than optimal page rank (and thereby hurting SEO).

##Making It Easier For Bots To Read
